# Why should I live?

Why do I live? What's the purpose of my life? This is my perspective of "why I should live".

## TL;DR

Just don't read this further.

## Life

The form of `life` could be various, as diverse as the number of species worldwide.

The `life` strives to sustain its existence and has distributed its form into many species like [k8](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview) to be fail-safe from service termination.

We, humans, are one of them, only a [single part of them](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods) as a species.

Thus, our task, our origin, and our purpose are also to sustain the form of `life`.

### Sustaining Myself

All software has its [EOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-of-life_product). All products get replaced. All human dies.

Why create them in the first place? Because they are meant to provide value.

Value to whom? It may vary, but for us, our end-user is `life`.

If I die, it won't affect much life from a global scope, 

Therefore as a man, a male, we are **responsible** of securing the action of "passing down the gene" which is simply protecting our children.

Extending to that, we may be involved to the next step, which is "ensuring our children to have their children".

Beyond the next 2 generations seems to be untouchable for us at the moment, therefore we can focus on our children.

In summary, our goal as a man is to secure our children and ensure them to have their own children.

This is our "responsibility for life".

## Responsibility

### Securing our children

To secure our children, first, we need to have at least a single child.
Since biologically we cannot reproduce on our own, it is destined to meet women.

There are complicated and numerous possibilities and options to meet the perfect love, but could be narrowed down into a single objective:

`fulfill the needs of female`

For female their responsibility is to `give birth`, and their `need` is just one: `security of offspring and self`.

To provide security, male needs to provide the followings:

1. Secure place
2. Capability to kick out intruders

Which are directly related to: `money` and `physique`.

### Ensuring the next generation

To ensure our children to have their children, it is pretty much the area of parenting, not just for male or female.
One thing is sure: `passing down these knowledge`. Making it easier for each generation to reproduce and be secure.
Which will let the generation earn time, and with this time, we can go beyond the **responsibility**.

## Contributing to the maintenance of "Life"

In any species, no matter what, every living being strive to live.

And us human seems to be the first (or at least currently) are the "chosen" species to maintain the overall "Life" of the earth.

Therefore after fulfilling the "basic" course of the responsibilities above, those generation or families who have time to contribute directly to the maintenance of life seems to be the ultimate goal for us.

## How?

### Securing our children

#### Money

We are responsible to provide secure place(home) and +@ of wealth for `passing down this knowledge` and education.
To earn money in current capitalism, IMO the two keywords are `humanity` and `value`.

People don't care whether you like them or not, they just don't open their wallet if you don't earn their heart.
We need to understand what they want, what they think, and how they would react.
Without these, we will never get paid for a right amount.

Next, value. As said above, we need to know what people want. Milk is $5 because the seller said so, but we buy it because we feel like it has $5 worth value.
So as we, we need to make people to feel like we are valuable to them. This itself is the actual value.

You may be "valuable", knowing all those web, mobile, cloud, all those CS knowledge, but the companies won't hire you if you don't make the HR manager "think that you are worth the value".

Therefore in summary, to earn money, we need to understand how people think, what they want, and make them feel like you are valuable.

#### Physique

This looks pretty simple, but is the hardest part above all.

You can be a coward and rich, but can't be a coward and a man.
I'm not saying that to be always frowning or act tough, it is the true masculinity in which be able to trust in self.
Never too narcissistic though.

Being in shape is not just to be attractive, but is an evidence of consistency and endurance.
Since muscles don't lie(steroids belong to cowards-those are off the topic).
MMA, BJJ, Boxing, no matter what man MUST learn any type of Martial Arts.
They not only make you able to defend, but teaches you how to control your mentality and being fair.

In summary, be in shape and learn martial arts to protect your wife and children.
