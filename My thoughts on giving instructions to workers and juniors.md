My thoughts on giving instructions to workers and juniors.

As I took charge of a project recently, I am doing a role as a project manager and development team lead.

Therefore I had several ideas about passing instructions and guidance to the workers.

IMO there are two types of Juniors (or learners):

1. Experience Stacker (ES)
2. Revolution Challenger (RC)

and I feel like the "right" way to guide them might be different.

For the `Experience Stacker`, the maximum output of this type is that: `Less likely to repeat previous mistakes or inefficiency.`

On the other hand, the `Revolution Challenger`'s max output is: `Bringing a better option to the table.`

Sticking back to the topic, therefore for the `ES`, when troubleshooting or to guide, give the minimum example of what you think is the right way.

This type depends much on seniors who are willing to learn the way you are doing.

On the other hand, for the `RC`, give zero actual examples but give several options you think the problem may be solved.
But not too broad, so including specific keywords would be great.

As a senior tho, always be balanced with the `growth` of the juniors & the project's quality and efficiency, especially for deadlines.
