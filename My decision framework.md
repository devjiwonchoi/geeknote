IMO the key points of life are as follows:

## Providing Value

The meaning of `value` for me is either `solving problems` or `improving efficiency`.

## Managing People

Includes leadership, placing human resources in the right place, and generally [how to win friends and influence people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Win_Friends_and_Influence_People).

## Succeeding Knowledge

Books are meant to pass down the knowledge of one's experience and knowledge, it is a cheat code for us to break through abilities we haven't experienced.

My decision is pretty much determined based on the key points above.

## Examples

### Providing Value

- Build a mobile app that solves certain problems.
- Fix some issues on open-source projects.

### Managing People

- Be in shape, work out.
- Go out on a date.
- Networking.

### Succeeding Knowledge

- Read essential books.
- Ask firm questions to mentors or seniors.
- Write documents on certain topics.
