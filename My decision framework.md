IMO the key points of life are as follows:

## Providing Value

The meaning of `value` for me is either `solving problems` or `improving efficiency`.

## Managing People

Includes leadership, placing human resources in the right place, and generally [how to win friends and influence people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Win_Friends_and_Influence_People).

## Succeeding Knowledge

Books are meant to pass down the knowledge of one's experience and knowledge, it is a cheat code for us to break through abilities we haven't experienced.

My decision is pretty much determined based on the key points above.

## Examples

### Providing Value

- Build a mobile app that solves certain problems.
- Fix some issues on open-source projects.

### Managing People

- Be in shape, work out.
- Go out on a date.
- Networking.

### Succeeding Knowledge

- Read essential books.
- Ask firm questions to mentors or seniors.
- Write documents on certain topics.

## Organizing Life

Based on the key points above, the limited resource in life, time, can be distributed.

1. Always look for problems or inefficiencies.
2. Work out & dress neatly.
3. Take care of girlfriend and friends. Actually take time to care about them.
4. Read books and interpret them in your own thoughts.
5. Always be willing to learn the skills needed for #1.
