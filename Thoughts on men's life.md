Thoughts on men's life.

Why am I living? Purpose of my life?

Most people would agree that it is the nature of those "living beings" to pass their genes to the next, to sustain the form of "life".

The form "life" could be in various shape, as diverse as the number of species in the world.

Us human are one of them, a single species, distributed responsibility of "secure" and "reproduce" to men and women respectively.

Therefore as a man, a male, we are **responsible** of securing the action of "passing down the gene" which is simply protecting our children.

Extending to that, we may be involved to the next step, which is "ensuring our children to have their children".

Beyond the next 2 generations seems to be untouchable for us at the moment, therefore we can focus on our children.

In summary, our goal as a man is to secure our children and ensure them to have their own children.

This is our "responsibility for life".

## Responsibility

### Securing our children

To secure our children, first, we need to have at least a single child.
Since biologically we cannot reproduce on our own, it is destined to meet women.

There are complicated and numerous possibilities and options to meet the perfect love, but could be narrowed down into a single objective:

`fulfill the needs of female`

For female their responsibility is to `give birth`, and their `need` is just one: `security of offspring and self`.

To provide security, male needs to provide the followings:

1. Secure place
2. Capability to kick out intruders

Which are directly related to: `money` and `physique`.

### Ensuring the next generation

To ensure our children to have their children, it is pretty much the area of parenting, not just for male or female.
One thing is sure: `passing down these knowledge`. Making it easier for each generation to reproduce and be secure.
Which will let the generation earn time, and with this time, we can go beyond the **responsibility**.

## Contributing to the maintenance of "Life"

In any species, no matter what, every living being strive to live.

And us human seems to be the first (or at least currently) are the "chosen" species to maintain the overall "Life" of the earth.

Therefore after fulfilling the "basic" course of the responsibilities above, those generation or families who have time to contribute directly to the maintenance of life seems to be the ultimate goal for us.
