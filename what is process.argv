Q: what is process.argv
a: The process.argv property returns an array containing the command-line arguments passed when the Node.js process was launched.
The first element will be process.execPath. See process.argv0 if access to the original value of argv[0] is needed.
The second element will be the path to the JavaScript file being executed. The remaining elements will be any additional command-line arguments.
